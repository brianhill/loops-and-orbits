    "# Coulomb Repulsion Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is intended to be self-contained. This means it might include material that you already fully understand. To make it easier to jump over material you already understand to the next question or step, there is some color-coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>Questions are marked in blue.</font> Your lab report should consist of a document that answers all the questions, including some that can be answered by taking screen shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=green>Steps are marked in green.</font>\n",
    "If the steps are not performed sequentially and accurately, subsequent steps probably will *not* work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder why this is?!? A Jupyter notebook works hand-in-hand with something called a kernel (some people call it an interpreter). The kernel remembers everything that has been sent to it. For example, if you first send the kernel `x=1` and then you send it `y=x+1` the memory that x is 1 is in the kernel, and y will evalute to 2. It *simply does not matter* if `x=1` is present in the notebook. It must be sent to the kernel for it matter. Working incrementally by passing small parts of programs to a kernel is valued for its interactivity, but it can also be error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "A corollary of the interaction between the notebook and the kernel is that if you quit the kernel and start over, you have to start from the beginning, even if you save the notebook. The new kernel\n",
    "has no memory of what might have been sent to a previous kernel, and it has no knowledge of what is in the notebook until it is re-sent. This is true despite the fact that the notebook you saved might still be displaying old kernel\n",
    "output!\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=green>S1: Find the menu called Kernel or Runtime. Under it is a menu item called Restart &amp; Clear Output or Restart Runtime. This gives you a fresh kernel. It also removes any old kernel output from the notebook. If you are on Google Colab the menu item will be greyed out because you haven't run anything yet. If you are on Binder, you can already try restarting and clearing all output. When all else fails, it is good to know that you can start from scratch.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "*NB: This notebook is self-guided. However, you have your lab professor (Prof. Gheith, Prof. Hill, Prof. Karelina, Prof. Kintner, or Prof. Lee) and your lecture professor (Prof. Rosario or Prof. Ray), to lean on if you get stuck. Please be proactive about emailing them to ask questions and make Zoom appointments so that you can get the most out of the notebook.*\n",

    "## Coulomb Repulsion Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Coulomb repulsion (between two like charges) is a 1/r^2 force like gravity. Things that can be varied are the sizes of the charges or even the signs of the charges (but we will keep them both positive), the initial positions, and the initial velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also add more charges, and more dimensions. We will stick with just two charges moving along a line (one dimension). We'll call this line the x-axis, and \"right\" will be positive x, and \"left\" will be negative x. Once you see how two charges in one dimension works, if you understand the notebook well, it would be within your reach to add a third charge, or even a second dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computer Lab Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually three very different goals in doing this computer lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Physics (Electricity &amp; Magnetism) Goal: Get more experience with properties of Coulomb's law (which you already did quite a lot with in the game of [Electric Field Hockey](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/electric-hockey)).\n",
    "2. Mathematics (Numerical Analysis) Goal: Get an idea of how the differential equations in Newton's Laws can be solved approximately using &ldquo;finite-difference methods.&rdquo;\n",
    "3. Computer Science (Programming) Goal: Learn the basics of writing and executing Python code in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're attempting three things simultaneously, it's fine if we only make a small amount of progress on each of them. Once you've gotten a start, you can build endlessly on these ideas, and you will if you take Physics 102.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coulomb's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume there are two charges that can move in one dimension. Here are their properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Charge 1: mass m<sub>1</sub>, charge q<sub>1</sub>, position x<sub>1</sub>, velocity v<sub>1</sub>\n",
    "* Charge 2: mass m<sub>2</sub>, charge q<sub>2</sub>, position x<sub>2</sub>, velocity v<sub>2</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are only in one dimension, x<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, and v<sub>2</sub>, are numbers not vectors. The subscripts refer to the two particles, not dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of the Coulomb force on the charges is:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = k &middot; |q<sub>1</sub>| &middot; |q<sub>2</sub>| / r^2\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = |x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taking Care of the Minus Signs\n",
    "\n",
    "To take care of the direction, and not just the magnitude, it is easier to write the force on charge 2 as:\n",
    "\n",
    "F<sub>2</sub> = k &middot; q<sub>1</sub> &middot; q<sub>2</sub> (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)/r^3\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check that this force is to the right if\n",
    "the charges have the same sign and charge 2 is to the right of charge 1. The nice thing about the way it is \n",
    "written is that it works for all the other cases (signs of the charge and relative positions of the charges).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have for the force on charge 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "F<sub>1</sub> = -F<sub>2</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Newton's Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's 2nd Law of Motion for each of the particles:\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation 4: m<sub>2</sub> dv<sub>2</sub>/dt = F<sub>2</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation 3: m<sub>1</sub> dv<sub>1</sub>/dt = F<sub>1</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "(Yes, it's a little weird to number the equations backwards.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finite-Difference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the two equations above, plus two equations that are so obvious you might\n",
    "not think to write them down, but they are important too:\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation 2: dx<sub>2</sub>/dt = v<sub>2</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation 1: dx<sub>1</sub>/dt = v<sub>1</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at Equation 1 and use the definition of the derivative to rewrite it:\n",
    "\n",
    "x<sub>1</sub>(t+&Delta;t) = x<sub>1</sub>(t) + &Delta;t &middot; v<sub>1</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is approximate! It becomes closer and closer to being true as &Delta;t &rarr; 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>Q1: Make sure you understand why the equation above is just a statement of the definition of the derivative. Then use Equation 2 to write down a similar equation for x<sub>2</sub>(t+&Delta;t).</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at Equation 3. First, divide through by m<sub>1</sub>. Then use the definition of the derivative to rewrite it:\n",
    "\n",
    "v<sub>1</sub>(t+&Delta;t) = v<sub>1</sub>(t) + &Delta;t &middot; F<sub>1</sub>/m<sub>1</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>Q2: Make sure you understand the equation above and then use Equation 4 to write down a similar equation for v<sub>2</sub>(t+&Delta;t).</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all we need! These are four &ldquo;finite-difference&rdquo; equations. Each of them tells you how to get one of the quantities from the quantities at an earlier time. They can get a lot more complicated depending on how you approximate the derivative, but the approximation we have done is enough to get some reasonable solutions to the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the limit that &Delta;t &rarr; 0. A question is how small must &Delta;t be so  that we get a good enough approximation. How about if &Delta;t is 1/100 of a second (10 milliseconds)? There has been no good reason given for choosing this particular value. It might be unnecessarily small. It might not be small enough. It's a guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters and Initial Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system of two charges has the laws above governing it, and it also has some initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that our initial conditions are that at time t=0 neither charge is moving and they are one meter apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as we use MKS units everywhere we won't have to carry units or units conversions around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we capture the initial conditions, some parameters, and also do some other initialization in Python:"

So age is an example of something that everyone agrees we should count from 0. If you are 18, you are actually in your 19th year. This is the 21st century, but the first two digits of the year are 2 and 0.

In many languages (C and Java, for example), indenting doesn't matter. It is only done for readability. What matters in those languages is where you put the curly brackets { }. Python avoids being littered with curly brackets by making the indenting count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, let's analyze the indented statements in the while loop. Look at the first \n",
    "one and imagine i is 8. In that case, that statement is\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    x1s[8] = x1s[7] + delta_t * v1s[7]\n",

    "```\n",
    "    x1_8 = x1_7 + delta_t * v1_7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we would have had to do it again and again for x1\\_9 all the way to x1\\_50.\n",

    "```\n",
    "    i = 8 + 1\n",

    "\n",
    "NB: You would have been reasonable to say that with `i = 8` the last indented statement was:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    8 = 8 + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
