### Standup 1

Going to add lift force to a tennis ball. Uncertainties: don't know how to get the lift coefficient as a function of spin.

Starting with an extremely simple model for rate of spin. Starting with the projectile motion model from the baseball notebook.

### Standup 2

Chart the path on tennis ball taking factors into consideration. Drag and lift, specifically.

Have a good basis for the motion. Having trouble updating the angles.

Ready to update the angles. Add a net into the graph.

Finish the spin and coefficient of lift function. Stretch goal: add 3-D.
