## Ryan and Ronnie &mdash; Golf Ball Lift

We will examine the spin of a golf ball and the forces of a golf ball in flight. Weâ€™ve looked at some websites with research about it, and we think we can model a golf ball flight. Brian suggests: look into whether a 3-D view is possible -- in which case slicing the ball to the left or right would be very cool. There are radar sensing measurements and models.

### Ryan and Ronnie Standup 1

Realistic models in 2-D or 3-D. Golf balls have dimples that accentuate the lift. Plans for today. Develop a simpmle equation for lift.

Lift is a function of angle.

### Ryan and Ronnie Standup 2

Only Ryan present.

Next step is tuning the model so that it is more realistic. Stretch goal is 3-D.
