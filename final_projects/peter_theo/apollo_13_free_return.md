### Peter and Theo Standup 1

Start by coding up the mooon's gravity using functions that are similar to those that you already have for the Earth's gravity.

Total acceleration will be the acceleration due to Earth's gravity plus the acceleration due to the Moon's gravity.
Massive simplification: keep the Moon fixed!

### Peter and Theo Standup 2

It is tricky to model the additional gravity of the Moon.
