## Venessa and Jack &mdash; Basketball Swisher

Our plan is to map out the path of a basketball. Focusing on the range of initial conditions which are mostly to result in a basket. Reflection off of the backboard.

Work with the angles depending on a set distance from the hoop. Lots of different trajectories can go through hoop.

### Venessa and Jack Standup 1

Will get started using the baseball notebook. Add reflection off backboard?!? Draw a hoop and backboard.

### Venessa and Jack Standup 2

Hard to do it, given error images. Currently the code for adding the court and the backboard gives errors. Brian suggests a single line segment rather than a whole image to represent the hoop and backboard.
