## Hunter &mdash; RC Circuit with AC Supply

With the resistor-capacitor combination, we can swap out the DC (direct current) voltage source and put in an AC (alternating current) voltage source. The resistor-capacitor combination is called an "RC" circuit. I'll be doing an RC circuit with an AC voltage source. It turns out you can make both a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter out of an RC circuit. The Jupyter notebook will study high-pass and low-pass filters made from RC circuits.

### Hunter Standup 1

First steps will be to code up the alternating current function.

### Hunter Standup 2

Yesterday got all the formulas and values into the code. Alternating current function. 1000 Hz is the medium frequency.

Low frequency (200 Hz), medium frequeny, and high frequency (5000 Hz).
