### Cindy Standup 1

Uncertainties: How to model? How many students are important? Consult with Kyle. Start with something simple. 100 students each with a mood running from 0 to 10. Start them all at 7.

### Cindy Standup 2

So far the model is just a declining mood for every student. Graph some sample students. Uncertainties how to make model have more features. External stress and spring break. Student-student interaction.
