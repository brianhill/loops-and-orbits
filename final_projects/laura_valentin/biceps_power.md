# Laura and Valentin &mdash; Biceps Power

[Laura and Valentin, Biceps Power](./gaby_andy/tennis_topspin.md)

From the field of kinesiology: Power curve analysis of different Biceps exercises in comparison to the Biceps power curve. We take different Biceps exercises and calculate the power curve based on the force (gravity) and then compare it to the power curve of the Biceps itself.

## Standup 1

Will be plotting torque curves. x-axis of plot is the degrees the joint is bent. 0 to 150 degrees. Most powerful at the 90-degree point. Will examine four different biceps exercises. (1) Stand straight and bend arm with normal downwards force of gravity. (2) Cable tower. The direction of the force always changes. For today our plan is to create or re-create a good graph of the power curve of the actual biceps. Biomechanics book is a reference. Cheap machine has a curve that does not match the human biceps will be one of the remaining four exercises.

## Standup 2

Yesterday we wwanted to start creating the power curve of the biceps. Instead created power curve of the equipment that exercises the biceps. The steps for today will be to create the model of the biceps. Visualization isn't telling you enough. So you are going to work on the visualization. Cumulative energy delivered by bicep, obtained by integrating the torque curve.
