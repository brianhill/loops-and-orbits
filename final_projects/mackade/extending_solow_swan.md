### Mackade Standup 1

Andras's model is pretty naive. Make it more realistic or more interactive. Start by adding two countries instaead of 1.
Next steps: A. Talk to Andras. B. Add a second coutnry to the plot.

### Mackade Standup 2

Yesterday got a second country into the notebook.

Investigating the Ramsey-Cass-Koopman extension of Solow-Swan.

Add variable savings rate -- put in some big changes during and after WWWII. Haven't got feedback from Andras (external dependency)
