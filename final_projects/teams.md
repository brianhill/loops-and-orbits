![Teams at Work](./TeamsAtWork-2020-01-27.jpeg)

## *Three Presentations Starting 11:00 on Thursday*

## Gaby and Andy &mdash; Tennis Ball Forehand Topspin

Forehand spin &mdash; topspin &mdash; of a tennis ball. Reference: Cross and Lindsey, "Measurements of drag and lift on tennis balls in flight," Sports Engineering (2014) **17**, 89-96.

### Gaby and Andy Standup 1

Going to add lift force to a tennis ball. Uncertainties: don't know how to get the lift coefficient as a function of spin. Starting with an extremely simple model for rate of spin. Starting with the projectile motion model from the baseball notebook.

### Gaby and Andy Standup 2

## Laura and Valentin &mdash; Biceps Exercise Equipment

From the field of kinesiology: Power curve analysis of different Biceps exercises in comparison to the Biceps power curve. We take different Biceps exercises and calculate the power curve based on the force (gravity) and then compare it to the power curve of the Biceps itself.

### Laura and Valentin Standup 1

Will be plotting torque curves. x-axis of plot is the degrees the joint is bent. 0 to 150 degrees. Most powerful at the 90-degree point. Will examine four different biceps exercises. (1) Stand straight and bend arm with normal downwards force of gravity. (2) Cable tower. The direction of the force always changes. For today our plan is to create or re-create a good graph of the power curve of the actual biceps. Biomechanics book is a reference. Cheap machine has a curve that does not match the human biceps will be one of the remaining four exercises.

### Laura and Valentin Standup 2

## Nancy and Ausmitha &mdash; Portfolio Depreciation

Asset depreciation. Depreciation models (one or more of straight line, accelerated, or compounding percentage). Reinvestment. Portfolio with multiple assets and asset classes.

### Nancy and Ausmitha Standup 1

Possibly add reinvestment and repairs for the assets. Straight-line method. Double-declining balance. Units of production depreciation model. Which is used for machinery. Starting today with a single asset and a single deprecation model.

### Nancy and Ausmitha Standup 2

## *Remaining Presentations Starting 9:15am on Friday*

## Hunter &mdash; AC Voltage in an RC Circuit

With the resistor-capacitor combination, we can swap out the DC (direct current) voltage source and put in an AC (alternating current) voltage source. The resistor-capacitor combination is called an "RC" circuit.

I'll be doing an RC circuit with an AC voltage source. It turns out you can make both a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter out of an RC circuit. The Jupyter notebook will study high-pass and low-pass filters made from RC circuits.

### Hunter Standup 1

First steps will be to code up the alternating current function.

### Hunter Standup 2

## Cindy with Kyle &mdash; Model of Depression and Anxiety

Modeling the spread of depression and anxiety in a population of students during the course of the semester. The model is not intended to be realistic. Possibly it could be made realistic. Consultant on project, senior in psychology, Kyle Krantz.

### Cindy Standup 1

Uncertainties: How to model? How many students are important? Consult with Kyle. Start with something simple. 100 students each with a mood running from 0 to 10. Start them all at 7.

### Cindy Standup 2

## Venessa and Jack &mdash; Basketball Trajectories (3-Pointers!?)

Our plan is to map out the path of a basketball. Focusing on the range of initial conditions which are mostly to result in a basket. Reflection off of the backboard.

Work with the angles depending on a set distance from the hoop. Lots of different trajectories can go through hoop. 

### Venessa and Jack Standup 1

Will get started the baseball. Add reflection off backboard?!? Draw a hoop and backboard.

### Venessa and Jack Standup 2

## Mackade &mdash; Adding Realism to Solow-Swan

Extending the Solow-Swan economic model.

### Mackade Standup 1

Andras's model is pretty naive. Make it more realistic or more interactive. Start by adding two countries instaead of 1.
Next steps: A. Talk to Andras. B. Add a second coutnry to the plot.

### Mackade Standup 2

## Matt and Nicolo &mdash; Kepler's 2nd Law

Proving that Kepler's 2nd Law (equal areas in equal times) works. Produce a visualization of the equal areas.

### Matt and Nicolo Standup 1

Uncertainties: how to show the graphs. Finding the area for a non-right triangle will be a bit of a challenge.

### Matt and Nicolo Standup 2

## Ryan and Ronnie &mdash; Lift on a Golf Ball During Flight

We will examine the spin of a golf ball and the forces of a golf ball in flight. Weâ€™ve looked at some websites with research about it, and we think we can model a golf ball flight. Brian suggests: look into whether a 3-D view is possible -- in which case slicing the ball to the left or right would be very cool. There are radar sensing measurements and models.

### Ryan and Ronnie Standup 1

Realistic models in 2-D or 3-D. Golf balls have dimples that accentuate the lift. Plans for today. Develop a simpmle equation for lift.

### Ryan and Ronnie Standup 2

## Peter and Theo &mdash; Apollo 13 Slingshot back to Earth

We have decided to make a simulation of a rocket orbiting earth and have it slingshot around the moon and come back to earth.

### Peter and Theo Standup 1

Start by coding up the mooon's gravity using functions that are similar to those that you already have for the Earth's gravity. Total acceleration will be the acceleration due to Earth's gravity plus the acceleration due to the Moon's gravity.
Massive simplification to start: keep the Moon fixed!

### Peter and Theo Standup 2

## Kevin &mdash; Voyager Slingshot off Venus

Model of a satellite leaving Earth and slingshotting to the outer planets and then out of the Solar system.

### Kevin Standup 1

Brian suggests getting started by slingshotting off of Venus. That was actually how the Voyagers did it, because they did not have enough fuel to go straight to the outer planets. So they first dropped inward to Venus.
