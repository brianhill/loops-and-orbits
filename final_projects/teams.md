## Gaby and Andy

Forehand spin &mdash; topspin &mdash; of a tennis ball. Reference: Cross and Lindsey, "Measurements of drag and lift on tennis balls in flight," Sports Engineering (2014) **17**, 89-96.

### Notes on Standup 1

Going to add lift force to a tennis ball. Uncertainties: don't know how to get the lift coefficient as a function of spin.

Start with the projectile motion model from the baseball notebook.

## Hunter

With the resistor-capacitor combination, we can swap out the DC (direct current) voltage source and put in an AC (alternating current) voltage source. The resistor-capacitor combination is called an "RC" circuit. I'll be doing an RC circuit with an AC voltage source. It turns out you can make both a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter out of an RC circuit. The Jupyter notebook will study high-pass and low-pass filters made from RC circuits.

### Notes on Standup 1

First steps will be to code up the alternating current function.

## Cindy with Kyle

Modeling the spread of depression and anxiety in a population of students during the course of the semester. The model is not intended to be realistic. Possibly it could be made realistic. Consultant on project, senior in psychology, Kyle Krantz.

### Notes on Standup 1

Uncertainties how to get started. How to model. How many students are important to Rope Kyle in.

## Laura and Valentin

From the field of kinesiology: Power curve analysis of different Biceps exercises in comparison to the Biceps power curve. We take different Biceps exercises and calculate the power curve based on the force (gravity) and then compare it to the power curve of the Bizeps itself.

### Notes on Standup 1

Torque curve. X-axis is the degrees the joint is bent. 0 to 150 degrees. Most powerful at the 90 degree point.

Also considered leg extension. Will make power curves. 

Four different biceps exercises. Stand straight and bend arm with normal downwards.

Cable tower. The direction of the force always changes.

For today our plan is to create or re-create a good graph of the power curve of the actual biceps.

Biomechanics book is a reference.

Cheap machine has a curve that does not match the human biceps.

## Venessa and Jack

Our plan is to map out the path of a basketball. Focusing on the range of initial conditions which are mostly to result in a basket. Reflection off of the backboard.

Work with the angles depending on a set distance from 

### Notes on Standup 1

Uncertanties in getting strated. With get started the baseball.

Draw a hoop and backboard.

## Mackade

Extending the Solow-Swan economic model.

### Notes on Standup 1

Andras's model is pretty naive. Maybe make it more real or more interactive.

Two countries instaead of 1.

Country 2 vs. country 1.

A. Talk to Andras.
B. Add a second coutnry to the plot.

## Matt and Nicolo

Proving that Kepler's 2nd Law (equal areas in equal times) works.

Produce a visualization of the equal areas.

### Notes on Standup 1

1. Uncertainties. How to show the graphs.
2. Finding the area for a non-right triangle will be a bit of a challenge.

## Ryan and Ronnie

We will examine the spin of a golf ball and the forces of a golf ball in flight. Weâ€™ve looked at some websites with research about it, and we think we can model a golf ball flight. Brian suggests: look into whether a 3-D view is possible -- in which case slicing the ball to the left or right would be very cool. There are radar sensing measurements and models.

### Notes on Standup 1

Realistic models in 2-D or 3-D.

Golf balls have dimples that accentuate the lift.

Plans for today. Develop an equation for this.

## Nancy and Ausmitha

Asset depreciation. Depreciation models (one or more of straight line, accelerated, or compounding percentage). Reinvestment. Portfolio with multiple assets and asset classes.

### Notes on Standup 1

Reinvestment and repairs for the assets. Straight-line method. Double-declining balance. Compounding.

Units of production depreciation model. Which is used for machinery.

Uncertainties about how to get going today.

Start with a single asset.

## Peter and Theo

We have decided to make a simulation of a rocket orbiting earth and have it slingshot around the moon and come back to earth.

### Notes on Standup 1

Start by coding up the mooon's gravity using functions that are similar to those that you arlready have for the Earth's gravity.

Then the satellite's acceleration will be the acceleration due3 to eath's grvai9ty the acceleratio0n due to.

Simplifixatin.

Uncertainties:.

## Kevin

Model of a satellite leaving Earth and slingshotting out of the ssolar stystem like Voyager.
