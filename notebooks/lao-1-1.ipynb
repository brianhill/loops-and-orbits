    "\n",
    "What you reading right now is documentation not code. Documentation is written in Markdown. There are multiple versions of Markdown with slight differences. We are using [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). It can be handy to print out page 1 of the [GitHub-flavored Markwdown cheatsheet (PDF)](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) and put it over your desk. For starters, memorize how to get:\n",

    "Notice that the bullets have turned into asterisks, and the heading line at the top begins with a pound-sign (also called the octothorpe, the number symbol, or the hash symbol &mdash; hence the expression, hashtag). The sub-heading begins with two pound signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer science is laced with endless puns. Markdown is a pun. The idea was that the various markup languages (for marking up documents with title fonts and bulleted lists, etc.), especially HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language had gotten grossly complex.\n",

    "Valid Python is a sequence of statements. Each statement has to be valid for the Python to be valid.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each of the above four boxes contains valid Python. Click in each of them and then hit Shift-Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you should evaluate every statement in this notebook to see what it does. If you aren't completely clear on what it does and why it does it, keep playing with it until you are.\n",

    "### Cells and Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the Python statements above got their own boxes. You actually are allowed to put multiple statements in a box, but I am starting simply.\n",
    "\n",
    "These boxes are Python, not Markdown. Somehow Jupyter needs to know that 2 + 2 was Python, not more documentation, right? The boxes are part of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start using the official names for the boxes. They are called cells, and so you now have been introduced to the two main cell types: Markdown cells and code cells. Code cells have In[ ] next to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing to introduce is the notion of a kernel. It's a separate process. You can think of a process as a separate app, but one which has no on-screen representation. Whenever you execute a Python cell by hitting Shift-Enter the statements in it get sent to the kernel, which evaluates them. The kernel sends the result back to the notebook and the notebook renders that as an Out[ ] cell (unless there is no result). Sometimes the notebook renders other things as side effects of executing the statements (like graphs! &mdash; but we are not getting to that today).\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers in the brackets in the In and Out cells are sequential. The sequence is determined by their order in getting sent to the kernel, not the order they appear in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you hit Shift-Enter in a code cell, whatever is in the cell gets re-sent to the kernel and the number is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you don't hit Shift-Enter in a cell, then the kernel doesn't know about the statements in that cell.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Try hitting Shift-Enter multiple times in a cell. For example, just keep hitting Shift-Enter in the 2 + 2 cell. See the In/Out numbers increment? Ok, that's not very interesting, but it helps you understand the relationship of the cells to the kernel. Re-executing cells will get more interesting when the values in them start changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables and Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in ordinary mathematics, mathematics on computers uses variables. Variables hold values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a nice simple assignment statement that lets the kernel know about a new variable x:"

Now that we have named it, and sent the statement that names it to the kernel, the kernel will not forget that we have a variable named x. The kernel currently has 4 in x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice there is no Out statement to go with this In statement even after you hit Shift-Enter in it. That's because there is no result that comes with an assignment statement."
