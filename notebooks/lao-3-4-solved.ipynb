The idea we are going to implement is that our satellite is in a low circular orbit and we want to compute the rocket burns needed to get to a larger circular orbit. It turns out this can be achieved with two burns, the first burn puts the satellite into an elliptical orbit, and the second burn circularizes that orbit.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "By continued study of all of the notebooks we have done &mdash; all of which are posted on the [loops and orbits repo](https://github.com/observatree/loops-and-orbits) &mdash; I'm confident you can cement in the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get it cemented in, you will know as much as the typical science professor about making Python and Jupyter do your bidding. Saint Mary's faculty who specialize in computational methods, like Prof. Aaron Lee, Prof. Jessica Coyle, and Prof. Andr&aacute;s Margitay-Becht to name a few, can help you learn much more. Ask around in your department. Show the ones that are interested what you have learned. Doors will open and new ideas will flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I very much look forward to helping you apply the methods you have seen in these three weeks to the projects you choose in the final week of this course. My door is open most of the time, and you can make appointments for help."
