    "\n",
    "## Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is intended to be self-contained. This means it might include material that you already fully understand. To make it easier to jump ahead to the next question or step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions are marked in <font color=blue>blue</font>. Your lab report will consist of a document that answers all the questions and including some that can be answered by  taking screen shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps are marked in <font color=green>green</font>.\n",
    "If the steps are not performed sequentially and accurately, subsequent steps probably will *not* work, so make sure you do each step carefully and in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder why this is?!? A Jupyter notebook works hand-in-hand with something called a kernel (some people call it an interpreter). The kernel remembers everything that has been sent to it. For example, if you first send the kernel `x=1` and then you send it `y=x+1` the memory that x is 1 is in the kernel, and y will be 2. It *simply does not matter* if `x=1` is present in the notebook. It must be sent to the kernel for it matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A corollary is that if you quit the kernel and start over, you have to start from the beginning. The new kernel\n",
    "has no memory of what might have been sent to the previous kernel, and it has no knowledge of what is in the notebook until it is sent. This is true despite the fact that the notebook might still be displaying old kernel\n",
    "output! Very confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=green>S1: Find the menu item called Kernel. Under it is Restart &amp; Clear Output. This gives you a fresh kernel. It also removes any old kernel output from the notebook. Restart and clear all output.</font>\n",

    "## RL Circuit Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates a series circuit containing a resistor, an inductor, and a voltage source. The next level up in circuit complexity is to add a capacitor. *This notebook doesn't do that.* The circuit under consideration is sufficiently popular it has a name, &ldquo;the RL circuit.&rdquo; The R in RL stands for the resistance of the resistor, and the L stands for the inductance of the inductor (because the letter I is already used for current in this type of circuit and people decided to honor Emil Lenz, the Russian physicist who gave us Lenz's Law, by using L for inductance).\n",

    "In the drawing above, you need to imagine two things. A voltage source (either a battery or a function generator) would be connected to the two terminals labeled V<sub>in</sub>. This addition to the circuit is needed to complete it. Without it, there is no closed circuit and it can't do anything at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "A multimeter set to measure voltage (or better yet, an oscilloscope) might be connected to the two terminals labeled V<sub>L</sub>. Don't think of the multimeter as another addition to the circuit. A multimeter set to measure voltage or an oscilliscope attempts to measure voltage *without disturbing it* and without drawing much current.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>Q1: Contemplate the previous paragraph, then answer &mdash; assuming that one of the most important components of a multimeter that is measuring voltage is an internal resistor, what can you say about this resistor?</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computer Lab Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually three very different goals in doing this computer lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Physics Goal: Get experience with properties of RL circuits.\n",
    "2. Mathematics Goal: Get an idea of how a differential equation can be solved approximately using &ldquo;finite-difference methods.&rdquo;\n",
    "3. Software Goal: Learn the basics of writing and executing Python code in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're attempting three things simultaneously, it's fine if we only make a small amount of progress on each of them. Once you've gotten a start, you can build endlessly on these ideas, and you will if you take Physics 102.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Circuit Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Kirchoff's Laws says that the sum of voltages around a circuit is 0. Going clockwise around the circuit above, we must have:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 = V<sub>in</sub> - V<sub>R</sub> - V<sub>L</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "The signs are there just because that's the way the arrows are drawn. You can draw the arrows any way you like.\n",
    "You just have to be consistent in the equation above and in the next two equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### V<sub>R</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "Look closely at the diagram. The person that drew it has the current going clockwise through the circuit. The voltage across the resistor is going to oppose the current flow. You can see that the person that drew the diagram has been helpful to us by drawing the V<sub>R</sub> arrow opposing the flow. So we don't have to put a minus sign in this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "V<sub>R</sub> = R &middot; I\n",
    "\n",
    "### V<sub>L</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the voltage across the inductor is going to oppose increasing current (that's one way of stating Lenz's Law), and once again, the artist has put it in that way, so we don't have to put a minus sign in this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "V<sub>L</sub> = L &middot; dI/dt\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differential Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting in we have\n",
    "\n",
    "0 = V<sub>in</sub> - R &middot; I - L &middot; dI/dt\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually you solve this for dI/dt, so it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "dI/dt = V<sub>in</sub>/L - I &middot; R/L\n",
    "\n",
    "The units of all three terms are Coulombs per second squared. Which are somewhat analogous to meters per second squared, the units for acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, if you put in I = dQ/dt and you also add a capacitor in series, you'd have the equation for an RLC circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "d<sup>2</sup>Q/dt<sup>2</sup> = V<sub>in</sub>/L - dQ/dt&middot;R/L - Q/(LC)\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks suspiciously similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> = F<sub>ext</sub>/m - c &middot; dx/dt/m - k &middot; x/m\n",
    "\n",
    "and indeed the LRC circuit and the damped harmonic oscillator have the same kind of solutions. *We're not going to add a capacitor.* This is weird. It is like leaving the spring out of the damped harmonic oscillator, in which case\n",
    "you'd have this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "dv/dt = F<sub>ext</sub>/m - c &middot; v/m\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that without the spring, you can write the equation in terms of the velocity. Mathematically, this is entirely analogous to what we are solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>Q2: Compare the equation for dI/dt with the equation for dv/dt. Mathematically, I is like v. Fill in: V<sub>in</sub> is like _____? L is like _____? R is like _____?</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finite-Difference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We have this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "dI/dt = V<sub>in</sub>/L - I &middot; R/L\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to approximate dI/dt by (I(t+&Delta;t)-I(t))/&Delta;t. Put that approximation in and solve for I(t+&Delta;t). You'll get:\n",
    "\n",
    "I(t+&Delta;t) = I(t) + &Delta;t &middot; (V<sub>in</sub>/L - I(t) &middot; R/L)\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all there is to it! This is called a finite-difference equation. It can get a load messier if we have second derivatives, but because we didn't put in a capacitor, we get to skip all that messiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us hope that we can get a good approximation to the equation if &Delta;t is 1/1000 of a second (1 millisecond). No good reason for choosing this particular value has been given. It might be unnecessarily small. It might not be small enough. For the moment, just consider to it to be a good guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters and Initial Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "A system has a some laws governing it (usually a differential equation), and it has some initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that our initial conditions are that initially no current is flowing, and let's put in a battery with a fixed voltage of 12V for V<sub>in</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use [this](https://www.mouser.com/Passive-Components/Inductors-Chokes-Coils/Images/_/N-5gb4?P=1yztpv4) whopping 300 mH inductor and a modest 50 &Omega; resistor.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as we use MKS units everywhere we don't have to carry units or units conversions around.\n",
